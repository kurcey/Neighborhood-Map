# Neighborhood-Map

# This project is for Kurt to be used in the Udacity FullStack Web course.

# Purpose of this project:

Develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

This project uses the Google maps API and also the Wikipedia API.
